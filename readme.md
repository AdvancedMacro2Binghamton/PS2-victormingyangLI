# Problem Set 2
Mingyang Li

I tried to solve the problems as much as I can. However, I was stuck on some 
parts. Here are my issues.
1) For parts 2 and 3, I am not sure whether to use the transition matrix and 
solve the stochastic problem or use the deterministical values of A_h and A_l 
respectively. 
2) For part 3, are savings K' or the difference between K' and leftover after 
consumption? If the former, then the same as K'; if the latter, the result is 
around zero. I don't know how to get savings.
3) For part 4, I created a rand number X within (0, 1) to simulate the 
probability in the stochastic process. I plug A_h as the initial state and let
it go. However, I have no clue on how to control the standard deviation of 
output by adjusting the value of A.
4) For part 5, using loops is easier to code than a different programming 
language since Matlab has the advantage of dealing with matrices.
